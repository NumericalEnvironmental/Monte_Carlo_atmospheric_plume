# Monte_Carlo_atmospheric_plume

![Preview](https://numericalenvironmental.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/air-dipsersion-equation.jpg?w=616)

Functionally equivalent R and Python 2.7 scripts to model air plume dispersion (R script has some post-processing features tacked on).
wind.txt file contains wind velocity distribution data required by the scripts.

More info can be found here: https://numericalenvironmental.wordpress.com/2016/10/16/monte-carlo-air-dispersion-modeling-r-versus-python/

I'd appreciate hearing back from you if you find the script(s) useful. Questions or comments are welcome at walt.mcnab@gmail.com.
